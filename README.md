# Cryptography-identification
The code of cryptography algorithms identification, the repository is consists of 3 parts: Cryptography materials; Deep learning models; Feature programming and entropy;
We use Python 3.7 with scki-learn, tensorflow and pytorch. In order to make the subjects clear, we upload some examples of features file which could verify the experiments. Hence, we did not upload the cryptography algorithms and the cipher texts. Each feature is chosen by one kind of dimension.
